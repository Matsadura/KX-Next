KX Trainer Free is a simple game utility for Guild Wars 2 that we've decided to make open-source. The code has evolved since its origin in 2018, and we believe in transparency for tools like this.

## Why Open-Source?

We believe transparency is important, especially for game tools. KX Trainer Free has been around for a while, and opening it up allows the community to see how it works, learn from it, or contribute.

While our main development efforts focus on the advanced features in our **[premium tools available at kxtools.xyz](https://kxtools.xyz)**, KX Trainer Free will be actively maintained to ensure it remains functional after Guild Wars 2 updates and to fix critical bugs. New features exclusive to the premium version will not be added here. We hope the community finds this base useful and potentially builds upon it.

## A Little History

Originating as a hobby project in 2018, KX Trainer Free has evolved significantly. The codebase, while functional in its earlier versions, has recently undergone substantial refactoring to improve structure, clarity, and maintainability, resulting in a much cleaner state.

## Contributions

We welcome contributions! Pull requests for **bug fixes**, **compatibility updates** following game patches, or **code improvements** are highly encouraged. While new features mirroring the paid version won't be merged, community-driven additions that fit the scope of the free trainer are welcome for discussion. Your input is valuable in keeping this tool functional for everyone.
